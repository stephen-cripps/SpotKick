# SpotKick
SpotKick looks at upcoming gigs for the artists youâ€™re tracking in Songkick. Tracked rtists who have a gig coming within the next month are added to the following playlists, using their top tracks. 
- All upcoming gigs in the next 30 days
- Gigs you are interested in or going to
- Gigs you are going to

It can also make a spreadsheet of 'interested' and 'going' shows

# Running the Program
To run the code, you will need to duplicate the create and App.Config file, matching the App.Config.Template File but with your own Songkick APi key, which can be requested from [https://www.songkick.com/api_key_requests/new](here).
